#Inheritance in python on basic level basically in terms of calling the parent constructor is same as js but in python things in oops is more explicit than js 

# super().__init__() is necessary to ensure the parentâ€™s constructor runs and initializes its attributes properly.
# Without calling super(), you can still access parent methods, but any attributes dependent on the parentâ€™s constructor will not exist.
# Itâ€™s a good practice to always call super() unless you have a very specific reason not to.
# Python gives you flexibility, but with great power comes great responsibility! ðŸ˜Š

#super()__init__() isn't called automatically in python if you don't call it it will not be called 
#but still you can use the parent class method using Parent_name.method() but if this method using any attribute of parent class and which is not initialized for sure cause you haven't run the constructor so you will get an attribute error
